# beast2-beagle-cuda
This is fork from broadinstitute version. 

GPU-accelerated Docker images containing [BEAST2](http://www.beast2.org) and [BEAGLE](http://beast.community/beagle), compiled with [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) support

**Note:** BEAST2 is separate and different from BEAST. If you're looking for Dockerized BEAST with BEAGLE, see this repo: https://github.com/broadinstitute/beast-beagle-cuda

**IMPORTANT:** The XML file provided to BEAST2 will need to be generated by a version of BEAUTi2 compatible with the version of BEAST2 distributed within the Docker image (currently v2.5.0)

```
git clone https://github.com/thavinb/beast2-beagle-cuda-docker.git
